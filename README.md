# DaprTool CLI
This repository is based on [https://github.com/DarqueWarrior/MyDaprDemos] made by [Donovan Brown](https://github.com/DarqueWarrior)
The tool is created as a [.NET Tool](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/global-tools) and contains a variaty of Dapr demos, which are described [here](https://github.com/mbn-ms-dk/DaprTool/blob/main/demos/documentation/demos.md).

There are probably errors and other _interesting_ experiences, but have fun :)
